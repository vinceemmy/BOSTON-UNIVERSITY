# Observations 

### The above data shows that; 
#### The average height and weight between the Males and Females are almost at the same level.
#### In the Smokers and Nonsmokers data there are students who did not specify which category they belong to and the number of those students are higher than that of those who don’t smoke, thereby making our analysis far from being accurate.
#### The blood type “O” has the highest number of students.
#### There are also records of students who did not specify if they have diabetes or not and this also makes our analysis inaccurate
#### The figures on other data such as the Average Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Temperate, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure and Cholesterol are at almost the same level between the Male and Female students.

# Comments
#### Students who did not specify if they are smokers or not and students who did not specify if they have diabetes or not should be made to login into their school portal and complete the Forms so as to get a concise figure on both categories.
