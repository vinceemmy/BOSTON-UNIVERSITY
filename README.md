# Observations 

### The above data shows that; 
#### The average height and weight between the Males and Females are almost at the same level.
#### In the Smokers and Nonsmokers data there are students who did not specify which category they belong to and the figures seems to be higher than that of those who don’t smoke.
#### There are more students with the blood type “O”.
#### There are also records of students who did not specify if they have diabetes or not.
#### The figures on other data such as the Average Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Temperate, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure and Cholesterol are at almost the same level between the Males and Females.

# Comments
#### Students who did not specify if they are smokers or not and students who did not specify if they have diabetes or not should be made to login into their school portal and complete the Forms so as to get a concise figure on both categories.
